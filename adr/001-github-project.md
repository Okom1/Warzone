# Moving project documentation to GitHub

Decision Date: August 30, 2024

## Context

Having our documentation of the project mostly on Google Spreadsheets detailing weapon combos and REQ ranking, inspecting changes to the data has been done by confirming from other team members whether they've updated the spreadsheet or not.

The complexity of the project has also started to expand and there is a want for more organized project file storage.

## Decision

Following these complications, we've decided to pivot to a GitHub-based project platform where reference data about the project will mainly be stored. Discussion about the project will still stay within Discord.

## Reasoning

The amount of different data we've had to create and reference became too spread out and difficult to track changes of.

## Anticipated outcomes

More standardized formatting of data, ability to inspect and roll back changes, and learning to use GitHub and Git.

## Next steps

Members are recommended to get familiar with Git and GitHub.

## Conclusion, TL;DR

Due to lack of features provided by our previous tools, we've moved to using GitHub for our project, which we hope will solve some issues and centralize reference data about the project in one place.
